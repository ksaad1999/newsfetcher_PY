# News Fetcher in Python

"News Fetcher" downloads RSS Feeds from given URLs in the "start.py" and saves them as json_array in file. 
While the script does that, you can look in the articles (so it shows up the current RSS Feed entries)
This script is usually used for RSS Feeds from SHZ.de

## Getting Started

Just clone it and then run "setup.py"
After that just run the "start.py"

### Prerequisites

```
You need Python 3. :) 
Nothing else, the script installs the essential modules when you run the instructions in "Getting Started"
```

### Installing
